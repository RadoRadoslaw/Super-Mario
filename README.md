For the training purposes I created my own version of the game Super Mario. The game uses the engine provided by W84Soft (Allsenses)
The engine is responsible for:
Addition (exept  game.objects.push),
Removal,
Display,
Scaling
Updating objects during the game using the API features provided by web browsers,
Elements responsible for the collision system (with a few exceptions)
Sounds, music and graphics are not mine, I used most of them from free resources.

I 'm responsible for the creation:
Logic - health of enemies, damage from projectiles,
Event handlers - the player clicks an arrow on the keyboard, the player collides with another object.
All mechanics - shooting projectiles, leveling opponents with a jump
Transition between levels
User interface


Install requirements:

  •	Mozilla Firefox
  (In Mozilla Firefox you need to change "security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy" flag to false.
  To do it you need to go to about:config and then search for the flag you want to change).

How to use:
